                <p style="font-size: 18px;">
                    I am a passionate individual from Jamshedpur, a city known for its industrial legacy and beauty. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor's of Technology specializing in Computer Science and Engineering from CV Raman Global University, Bhubaneswar. I completed my schooling from Kerala Samajam Model School, Jamshedpur. 
                
                    As a B.Tech student, I have gained strong technical skills, particularly in programming languages like Java and C. My strengths lie in effective communication, impactful presentations, strategic problem-solving, and leadership qualities, which enable me to approach challenges with confidence and innovation. 
                
                    I received the Rinex Campus Ambassador certificate, which highlights my skills in leadership and communication. I have successfully completed the TCS Young Professional course, which has enhanced my professional and interpersonal skills, preparing me for the corporate environment. 
                
                    I recently completed a Project Management Job Simulation certification offered by Forage in collaboration with Accenture. This program provided me with practical, hands-on experience in managing projects, where I gained insights into key project management principles, including planning, execution, risk management, and team collaboration. 
                
                    Beyond academics, I enjoy playing chess, a hobby that sharpens my strategic thinking and decision-making skills. This has taught me patience, adaptability, and the importance of evaluating all possible outcomes before taking action. 
                
                    I am also deeply committed to staying at the forefront of emerging technologies and continuously upgrading my skills. Whether itâ€™s exploring new programming languages, delving into AI, or understanding the dynamics of cloud computing, I am always eager to learn and apply new concepts to real-world challenges. 
                
                    My ultimate goal is to contribute to the tech community by solving complex problems that have a positive impact on society.
